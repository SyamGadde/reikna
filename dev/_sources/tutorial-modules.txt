Tutorial: modules and snippets
******************************

Modules and snippets are important primitives in CLUDA which are used in the rest of ``reikna``, although mostly internally.
Even if you do not write modules yourself, you will most likely use operations from the :py:mod:`~reikna.cluda.functions` module, or common transformations from the :py:mod:`~reikna.transformations` module, which are essentially snippet and module factories (callables returning :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Snippet` and :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Module` objects).
Therefore it helps if you know how they work under the hood.


Snippets
========

Snippets are ``Mako`` template defs (essentially functions returning rendered text) with the associated dictionary of render keywords.
Some computations which are parametrized by custom code (for example, :py:class:`~reikna.elementwise.Elementwise`) require this code to be provided in form of a snippet with a certain call signature.
When a snippet is used in a template, the result is quite straightworward: its template function is called, rendering and returning its contents, just as a normal ``Mako`` def.

Let us demonstrate it with a simple example.
Consider the following snippet:

::

    add = Snippet("""
    <%def name="add(varname)">
    ${varname} + ${num}
    </%def>
    """,
    render_kwds=dict(num=1))

Now we can compile a template which uses this snippet:

::

    program = thr.compile("""
    KERNEL void test(int *arr)
    {
        int idx = get_global_id(0);
        int a = arr[idx];
        arr[idx] = ${add('x')};
    }
    """,
    render_kwds=dict(add=add))

As a result, the code that gets compiled is

::

    KERNEL void test(int *arr)
    {
        int idx = get_global_id(0);
        int a = arr[idx];
        arr[idx] = x + 1;
    }

The root code that gets passed to :py:meth:`~reikna.cluda.api.Thread.compile` can be viewed as a snippet with an empty signature.


Modules
=======

Modules are quite similar to snippets in a sense that they are also ``Mako`` defs with an associated dictionary of render keywords.
The difference lies in the way they are processed, and their def must take only one positional argument.
Consider a module containing a single function:

::

    add = Module("""
    <%def name="add(prefix)">
    WITHIN_KERNEL int ${prefix}(int x)
    {
        return x + ${num};
    }
    </%def>
    """,
    render_kwds=dict(num=1))

Modules contain complete C entities (function, macros, structures) and get rendered in the root level of the source file.
In order to avoid name clashes, their def gets a string which it has to use to prefix these entities' names.
If the module contains only one entity that is supposed to be used by the parent code, it is a good idea to set its name to ``prefix`` only, to simplify its usage.

Let us now create a kernel that uses this module:

::

    program = thr.compile("""
    KERNEL void test(int *arr)
    {
        int idx = get_global_id(0);
        int a = arr[idx];
        arr[idx] = ${add}(x);
    }
    """,
    render_kwds=dict(add=add))

Before the compilation render keywords are inspected, and if a module object is encountered, the following things happen:

1. This object's ``render_kwds`` are inspected recursively and any modules there are rendered in the same way as described here, producing a source file.
2. The module itself gets assigned a new prefix and its template function is rendered with this prefix.
   The result is attached to the source file.
3. The corresponding value in the current ``render_kwds`` is replaced by the newly assigned prefix.

With the code above, the rendered module will produce the code

::

    WITHIN_KERNEL int _module0(int x)
    {
        return x + 1;
    }

and the ``add`` keyword in the ``render_kwds`` gets its value changed to ``_module0``.
Then the main code is rendered and appended to the previously renderd parts, giving

::

    WITHIN_KERNEL int _module0(int x)
    {
        return x + 1;
    }

    KERNEL void test(int *arr)
    {
        int idx = get_global_id(0);
        int a = arr[idx];
        arr[idx] = _module0(x);
    }

which is then passed to the compiler.

Modules can reference snippets in their ``render_kwds``, which, in turn, can reference other modules.
This produces a tree-like structure with the snippet made from the code passed by user at the root.
When it is rendered, it is traversed depth-first, modules are extracted from it and arranged in a flat list in the order of appearance.
Their positions in ``render_kwds`` are replaced by assigned prefixes.
This flat list is then rendered, producing a single source file being fed to the compiler.


Shortcuts
=========

The amount of boilerplate code can be somewhat reduced by using :py:meth:`Snippet.create <reikna.cluda.Snippet.create>` and :py:meth:`Module.create <reikna.cluda.Module.create>` constructors.
For the snippet above it would look like:

::

    add = Snippet.create(
        lambda varname: "${varname} + ${num}",
        render_kwds=dict(num=1))

Note that the lambda here serves only to provide the information about the ``Mako`` def's signature.
Therefore it should return the template code regardless of the actual arguments passed.

If the argument list is created dynamically, you can use :py:func:`~reikna.helpers.template_def` with a normal constructor:

::

    argnames = ['varname']
    add = Snippet(
        template_def(argnames, "${varname} + ${num}"),
        render_kwds=dict(num=1))

With modules it is a bit simpler, since their call signature is fixed.
The shortcut constructor creates a ``Mako`` def with a single argument called ``prefix``:

::

    add = Module.create("""
    WITHIN_KERNEL int ${prefix}(int x)
    {
        return x + ${num};
    }
    """,
    render_kwds=dict(num=1))

Of course, both :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Snippet` and :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Module` constructors can take already created ``Mako`` defs, which is convenient if you keep templates in a separate file.


Nontrivial example
==================

Modules were introduced to help split big kernels into small reusable pieces which in ``CUDA`` or ``OpenCL`` program would be put into different source or header files.
For example, a random number generator may be assembled from a function generating random integers, a function transforming these integers into random numbers with a certain distribution, and an :py:class:`reikna.elementwise.Elementwise` computation calling these functions and saving results to global memory.
These two functions can be extracted into separate modules, so that a user could call them from some custom kernel if he does not need to store the intermediate results.

Going further with this example, one notices that functions that produce randoms with sophisticated distributions are often based on simpler distributions.
For instance, the commonly used Marsaglia algorithm for generating Gamma-distributed random numbers requires several uniformly and normally distributed randoms.
Normally distributed randoms, in turn, require several uniformly distributed randoms --- with the range which differs from the one for uniformly distributed randoms used by the initial Gamma distribution.
Instead of copy-pasting the function or setting its parameters dynamically (which in more complicated cases may affect the performance), one just specifies the dependencies between modules and lets the underlying system handle things.

The final render tree may look like:

::

    Snippet(
        Elementwise,
        render_kwds = {
          base_rng -> Snippet(...)
          gamma -> Snippet(
        }            Gamma,
                     render_kwds = {
                       uniform -> Snippet(...)
                       normal -> Snippet(
                     }             Normal,
                   )               render_kwds = {
                                     uniform -> Snippet(...)
                                   }
                                 )
