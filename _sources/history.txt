Release history
***************


0.2.4 (11 May 2013)
===================

* ADDED: ability to introduce new scalar arguments for nested computations
  (the API is quite ugly at the moment).

* FIXED: handling prefixes properly when connecting transformations to nested computations.

* FIXED: bug in dependency inference algorithm which caused it to ignore allocations in nested computations.


0.2.3 (25 Apr 2013)
===================

* ADDED: explicit :py:meth:`~reikna.cluda.api.Thread.release` (primarily for certain rare CUDA use cases).

* CHANGED: CLUDA API discovery interface (see the documentation).

* CHANGED: The part of CLUDA API that is supposed to be used by other layers was moved to the ``__init__.py``.

* CHANGED: CLUDA ``Context`` was renamed to ``Thread``, to avoid confusion with ``PyCUDA``/``PyOpenCL`` contexts.

* CHANGED: signature of :py:meth:`~reikna.cluda.api.Thread.create`; it can filter devices now, and supports interactive mode.

* CHANGED: :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Module` with ``snippet=True`` is now :py:class:`~reikna.cluda.Snippet`

* FIXED: added ``transformation.mako`` and ``cbrng_ref.py`` to the distribution package.

* FIXED: incorrect parameter generation in ``test/cluda/cluda_vsizes/ids``.

* FIXED: skipping testcases with incompatible parameters in ``test/cluda/cluda_vsizes/ids`` and ``sizes``.

* FIXED: setting the correct length of :py:attr:`~reikna.cluda.api.DeviceParameters.max_num_groups` in case of CUDA and a device with CC < 2.

* FIXED: typo in ``cluda.api_discovery``.


0.2.2 (20 Apr 2013)
===================

* ADDED: ability to use custom argument names in transformations.

* ADDED: multi-argument :py:func:`~reikna.cluda.functions.mul`.

* ADDED: counter-based random number generator :py:class:`~reikna.cbrng.CBRNG`.

* ADDED: :py:class:`~reikna.elementwise.Elementwise` now supports argument dependencies.

* ADDED: Module support in CLUDA; see :ref:`tutorial-modules` for details.

* ADDED: :py:func:`~reikna.helpers.template_def`.

* CHANGED: ``reikna.cluda.kernel.render_template_source`` is the main renderer now.

* CHANGED: ``FuncCollector`` class was removed; functions are now used as common modules.

* CHANGED: all templates created with :py:func:`~reikna.helpers.template_for` are now rendered with ``from __future__ import division``.

* CHANGED: signature of :py:meth:`~reikna.core.operation.OperationRecorder.add_kernel` takes a renderable instead of a full template.

* CHANGED: :py:meth:`~reikna.cluda.api.Thread.compile_static` now takes a template instead of a source.

* CHANGED: :py:class:`~reikna.elementwise.Elementwise` now uses modules.

* FIXED: potential problem with local size finidng in static kernels (first approximation for the maximum workgroup size was not that good)

* FIXED: some OpenCL compilation warnings caused by an incorrect version querying macro.

* FIXED: bug with incorrect processing of scalar global size in static kernels.

* FIXED: bug in variance estimates in CBRNG tests.

* FIXED: error in the temporary varaiable type in :py:func:`reikna.cluda.functions.polar` and :py:func:`reikna.cluda.functions.exp`.


0.2.1 (8 Mar 2013)
==================

* FIXED: function names for kernel ``polar()``, ``exp()`` and ``conj()``.

* FIXED: added forgotten kernel ``norm()`` handler.

* FIXED: bug in ``Py.Test`` testcase execution hook which caused every test to run twice.

* FIXED: bug in nested computation processing for computation with more than one kernel.

* FIXED: added dependencies between :py:class:`~reikna.matrixmul.MatrixMul` kernel arguments.

* FIXED: taking into account dependencies between input and output arrays as well as the ones
  between internal allocations --- necessary for nested computations.

* ADDED: discrete harmonic transform :py:class:`~reikna.dht.DHT`
  (calculated using Gauss-Hermite quadrature).


0.2.0 (3 Mar 2013)
==================

* Added FFT computation (slightly optimized PyFFT version + Bluestein's algorithm for non-power-of-2 FFT sizes)

* Added Python 3 compatibility

* Added Thread-global automatic memory packing

* Added polar(), conj() and exp() functions to kernel toolbox

* Changed name because of the clash with `another Tigger <http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki/Tigger>`_.


0.1.0 (12 Sep 2012)
===================

* Lots of changes in the API

* Added elementwise, reduction and transposition computations

* Extended API reference and added topical guides


0.0.1 (22 Jul 2012)
===================

* Created basic core for computations and transformations

* Added matrix multiplication computation

* Created basic documentation
