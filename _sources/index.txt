Tigger, the pure Python GPGPU library
=====================================

Tigger is a library containing various GPU algorithms.
The main design goals are:

* separation of computation cores (matrix multiplication, random numbers generation etc) from simple transformations on their input and output values (scaling, typecast etc);
* separation of the preparation and execution stage, maximizing the performance of the execution stage at the expense of the preparation stage (in other words, aiming at large simulations)
* partial abstraction from Cuda/OpenCL
